------------------ REDSPARC DEVELOPMENT KIT README ----------------------

-------------------------- INSTALLATION ---------------------------------

Compilation and installation on Unix should be pretty simple. Just run

	make

and then run

	make install

NOTE FOR UNIX USERS: If you wish to specify a custom path for the
libraries, pass LIB_PATH=/path/to/libs to make. Likewise, if you wish to
install the binaries in a custom path, pass INSTALL_PATH=/path/to/install
to make.

NOTE FOR WINDOWS USERS: Compiling on Windows is no different from
compiling on Unix. Running "make install", however, will not work as the
makefile uses the Unix cp command. You will have to manually copy the
files to whatever directory you want them stored in.
